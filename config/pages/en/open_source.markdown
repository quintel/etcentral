# Open Source

Before the end of the year, the Energy Transition Model aims to become a fully
**open source project**. Institutes, companies and individuals will then be
able to *access*, *review* and *improve*:

* all **data**
* all **calculations and definitions**
* all **software**

Once approved by Quintel, such changes will become part of the Energy
Transition Model and thereby become available to the whole Energy Transition
Model community.

## Data

With this, everybody can review the ETM in fully transparant way. This may be
useful for scientific purposes.

In addition, people can change the behavior of the ETM by:

* Add new countries and technologies
* Update specifications to the latest insights

## Calculations and definitions

High level calculations such as the `percentage of renewable energy use` are
written in our own Graph Query Language (GQL).

Lower level calculations, such as the `CO2 emissions`, `total costs` the by a certain technology
are written in [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org).

## Software

The Energy Transition Model consists of:

* the calculation engine
* the professional interface
* the Energy Game
* the Energy Mixer
* the datasets
* ... and much more

All these parts will be available to interested parties.

## How does it technically work?

* Graph Query Language
* Ruby

Git, create fork, send pull request, this will be then merged if approved by
Quintel.

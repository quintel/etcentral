# Open Source

The Energy Transition Model is a fully **open source project**.
Institutes, companies and individuals are be able to *access*, *review*
and *improve*:

* all **data**
* all **calculations and definitions**
* all **software**

We especially invite consultancies, universities and knowledge institutes to
create their own Energy Transition Model for their region anywhere in the
world based on IEA data. Anyone may add new countries and technologies to the
dataset, improve existing ones, create new modules for the ETM or even overhaul
the programming code.

Once approved by Quintel, such changes will become part of the Energy
Transition Model and thereby be available to the whole Energy Transition
Model community.

All our open source repositories can be found on
[github.com/quintel](http://github.com/quintel). Our most important
repositories are:

* for data: [etsource](http://github.com/quintel/etsource)
* for source data: [etdataset](http://github.com/quintel/etdataset-public)
* for calculation: [etengine](http://github.com/quintel/etengine)
* for the professional interface: [etmodel](http://github.com/quintel/etmodel)

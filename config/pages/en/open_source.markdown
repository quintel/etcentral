# Open Source

Before the end of the year, the Energy Transition Model aims to become a fully
**open source project**. Institutes, companies and individuals will then be
able to *access*, *review* and *improve*:

* all **data**
* all **calculations and definitions**
* all **software**

Anyone may add new countries and technologies to the dataset, improve existing ones, create new modules for the ETM or even overhaul the programming code.   
Once approved by Quintel, such changes will become part of the Energy
Transition Model and thereby be available to the whole Energy Transition
Model community.

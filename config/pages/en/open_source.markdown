# Open Source

Before the end of the year, the Energy Transition Model aims to become a fully
**open source project**. Institutes, companies and individuals will then be
able to *access*, *review* and *improve*:

* all **data**
* all **calculations and definitions**
* all **software**

Once approved by Quintel, such changes will become part of the Energy
Transition Model and thereby become available to the whole Energy Transition
Model community.

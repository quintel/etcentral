# Quality control of modeling and data

Even though The Energy Transition model is the result of tens of man-years of work, it will never be a completely 'finished' product. To guarantee the reliability of the ever changing ETM, Quintel applies a process of continous improvement. We actively involve [partners](http://energietransitiemodel.nl/partners) and users in this process.

As can be seen from our ['known issues' page](http://energietransitiemodel.nl/known_issues), the ETM still has some room for improvement. The order in which these issues are dealt with, is dependent both on its seriousness and the priority that Quintel and partners assign to it. Big improvements obviously need funding to be feasible. 

## Process of improvement

Quintel is continuously improving and maintaining data and modeling. We aim at keeping the ETM up to standard of renowned experts who validate parts of the data and modeling on a regular basis. Although there is not yet a system in place where an authorized organization publicly states the correctness of the ETM, we are working hard to make the validation of the ETM a more public affair. One recent breakthough is that the ETM has become an ['open source'](http://energietransitiemodel.nl/pages/open_source) project. All code and data (with the exception of the IEA data) has become public and can be used free of charge.

When validating controversial subjects, we always involve parties with different, or even contrasting, interests to ensure the objectivity of the data. Properties of electric cars, for example, have been validated with Enexis and Essent, but also with Shell. Above all, Quintel relies whenever possible on its own research and published reports and articles. The latter are available in our publicly [library](http://refman.et-model.com/).

Because the ETM only uses physical laws and solid facts (like the carbon content of fuels), most topics are hardly percieved as being controversial. A more serious problem for Quintel is that some data is very hard to get by. Examples include 'sensitive' information about financial compensation of electricity plants for heat delivered to a heat network and hard-to-quantify insulation characteristics of office buildings. 

Omdat het ETM alleen gebruik maakt van 'harde' wetten en bekende feiten, zoals de koolstofinhoud van brandstoffen of de efficiÃ«nties van centrales bijvoorbeeld, blijken verreweg de 

## Parties

Our partners play a prominent role in our validation and quality control. Our extensive network of partners allows us to easily find knowledgable people to guide us in making the right changes to the ETM. 

User feedback is essential to detect issues and topics in need of improvement. By offering the ETM free of charge, we reach as many users as possible and ensure that all parts of the model are used and checked.

With all improvements and changes, responisibility lies with Quintel. This means that Quintel has the final word in which data and modeling will be used for the ETM.

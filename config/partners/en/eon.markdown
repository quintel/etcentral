### Ambition and position within a sustainable future for energy
E.ON has closely meshed plans in the Benelux area and Europe. We are uniquely aware of the far-reaching choices ahead. The way we act as one of the world’s biggest energy companies – whether in terms of TWh generated or the scale of our sustainable energy production – is evidenced in global statistics. This growth helps determine our mindset and approach. Shouldering this responsibility is our aim and obligation with an eye to personnel, customers and shareholders.

Almost without exception parties in Europe focus on some 80 percent renewable energy sources – like wind, solar and biomass - around 2050, with matching reductions in CO2 emissions . However, while environmental bodies seek the fastest possible switch to solar and wind power, we believe in a more phased transition. Affordability and security of supply are among our priorities in this context. E.ON believes in a combined approach with increasing investment in the sustainable generation of energy and making conventionally generated energy sustainable. We also work with our customers to realize savings at home and in the workplace.

Clear communication, openness to dialogue and insights into the true facts are all mandatory in the energy transition and the choices made by E.ON. To this end E.ON works with other companies and organisations in the energy sector within the Energy Transition Model (ETM) towards data as a basis for valid and sound conclusions.

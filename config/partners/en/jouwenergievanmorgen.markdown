### About your future... and that of your energy
What will your energy be in 2030? How will you heat your home in 2040? Will cars still be driving around in 2050? There is no straightforward answer to these questions! The future supply of energy poses an important challenge for young people of today!

The Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences of Groningen University and GasTerra are challenging them to contribute to finding usable solutions for tomorrow’s energy. This is being done in and around the Your Energy of Tomorrow truck: a travelling laboratory. An inspiring lecture hall in which we are travelling around the pre-university education (VWO) schools in the Netherlands in order to explore the future with students. We look at the problems that need to be solved for that purpose. And at ways in which those young people of today can contribute to finding those solutions, e.g. by opting for a fascinating programme of studies at the Faculty.

### Science and energy
The Your Energy of Tomorrow truck offers a lesson and lecture programme which focuses in virtually all cases on energy. With themes closely related to subjects such as Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Mathematics, Astrology, Information Science and Artificial Intelligence, pupils are challenged to contribute to the thought processes and work on solutions. To give some examples: Make your own solar cell and take part in the competition for the highest output. Build an efficient windmill. Join in with calculating scenarios for your energy of tomorrow. And much, much more…

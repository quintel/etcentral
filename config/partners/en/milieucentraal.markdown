### About Milieu Centraal
Milieu Centraal is a public information service about energy and the environment in everyday life. On our website [www.milieucentraal.nl](http://www.milieucentraal.nl) (only in Dutch) you find a lot of information about the environmental impact of everyday behaviour and how to diminish this impact. Subjects such as energy use, transportation, food and several other topics are discussed. Milieu Centraal works in collaboration with governmental and non-governmental organizations, companies and media.

### Why contribute?
Milieu Centraal tries to move people towards energy saving. The Energy Transition Model shows how large the effect of combined individual efforts can be. By contributing to the Energy Transition Model, Milieu Centraal hopes to influence consumers to make that step in their own life.

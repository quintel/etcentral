The Delft Energy Club is a Delft Energy Initiative. We are a platform organized by students with energy as core focus. We are the link towards all the TU Delft students interested in energy. We connect students, academics and professionals and strive to inspire and educate them so that our network of energy conscious young professionals and entrepreneurs will claim their role in society. We organize various events including lectures, excursions in the Netherlands and abroad, the All Energy Day, Cleantech Challenge and the Energy Festival. We are very open for collaboration opportunities with other organizations that are also active within the energy sector.

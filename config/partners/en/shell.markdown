The coming 50 years, governments, energy producers and energy consumers together have to do three things simultaneously: meet the demand for energy, maintain energy resources at an acceptable level and limit the consequences for the environment and society. This is no simply task. Currently, Shell already has running projects that contribute to this.

### Future & Society
In everything we do, we have to take the economy, society and the environment into account. Shell translates this into commercial and ‘social’ investments.

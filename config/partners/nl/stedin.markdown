### About Stedin

Stedin provides safe and continuous transport of gas and electricity to more than two million customers in and around three of the four big cities in Randstad, as well as the Rotterdam harbour area. In 2008 Stedin was the first grid operator in the Netherlands that introduced its own name and positioning. In the same year Stedin invested € 290 million in the improvement and renovation of the electricity and gas grids. This was € 45 million more than in 2007. It concerned replacement investments in the gas grids, expansion of the transport capacity on behalf of the growers in the Oostland and Tinte areas, as well as making possible sustainable energy transport.

### Looking ahead

Increasingly more clients want to pay a positive contribution to the environment and to society, and sustainability plays an ever more important role. In the coming years Stedin will use its competencies and expertise in order to facilitate the transition to sustainable energy. This means that Stedin wants to focus on other transport facilities than gas and electricity, such as steam, CO2 and possibly hydrogen. As far as innovation is concerned, Stedin focuses strongly on smart networks and green gas. Innovations are aimed at increasing sustainability, as well as at improving the existing grid.

### Why sponsorship?

Stedin acknowledges the value and necessity of facilitating the energy transition. It is however not clear what the future will bring. Will it be electric cars or cars powered by green gas after all? Will heat pumps be employed on a big scale or will there be windmills on rooftops? For the time being no one has the answer to these questions. The Energy Transition Model can hopefully provide more clarity as to the desired direction, as well as take away a number of uncertainties. In Stedin’s opinion the current Energy Transition Model paints a good picture of the influence the energy transition has. Importance is given to the ongoing discussion that goes beyond creating scenarios for sustainable energy generation, for example. By sponsoring the model Stedin gets the opportunity to develop the grid management dimension together with the other grid operators, in order to get clarity about the influence of different energy transition scenarios on the grid itself. By adding this extra element, the role of the grid operator in the energy transition period to come will be emphasized.

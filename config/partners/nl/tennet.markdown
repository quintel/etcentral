### About TenneT

We take electricity for granted in our everyday lives. Without thinking about it, we turn on the lights or the coffee machine. But these routine actions would not be possible without having somebody to supply the power. The Netherlands has an effective and reliable electricity supply system.

As the Dutch Transmission System Operator, TenneT TSO has a duty to monitor the continuity and security of the electricity supply in the Netherlands, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

In addition to administering the national transmission grid and safeguarding the reliability and continuity of the Dutch electricity supply, TenneT provides services and performs duties aimed at developing the electricity market and ensuring that it functions properly. We also provide services that support free-market operation and further the development of a sustainable energy supply system. On this website you will find comprehensive information about TenneT, who we are, what we do and how you can contact us at www.tennet.org

### Transition to a sustainable energy supply
The Dutch government has formulated the 20-30-2 rule as her objective for 2010. This rule means in 2020 20% sustainable energy sources, 30% CO2 reduction and 2% per year energy savings on consumption. To reach this objective, one of the ideas is to install a number of windfarms at sea, having a combined capacity of at least 6,000 MW. With the possibility to connect these windfarms directly to the national grid one of the barriers for the developers of windfarms has been taken away. TenneT will be responsible for realizing and maintaining the national grid at sea. With the current project "Wind at sea" TenneT has started to prepare herself for the role as TSO at sea.

Also energy storage is a subject of importance to TenneT. Investigations are made regarding the possibilities of an energy-island or the use of hydro-storage in Norway. Possibilities regarding the use of electrical cars to store energy, are also an interesting option.

TenneT therefore supports the development of the Energy Transition Model. Using various scenarios regarding production and load, this model provides information about the consequences of the transition to a sustainable energy supply. Consequences such as realization of the 20-30-2 rule or the cost of energy will be clear. Especially the awareness function by using this model is important for TenneT.

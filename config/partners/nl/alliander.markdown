### A pioneer in the energy transition
As a grid management company Alliander plays an important role in the transition from fossil fuels to sustainable energy sources. Following our mission, our task is to ensure a reliable energy supply. We have both an expert and a social role to play and as such we are working to make possible future scenarios, which include decentralized energy generation, smart energy networks, electric cars, biomass from cattle-breeding or a solar collector on everyone's roof.

### Collaboration
The importance that energy has for the clients to which we deliver our products and services is crucial in the way Alliander does business. We cannot bring about future developments as a single network company, which is why we collaborate with other stakeholders. Next to testing electric cars ourselves, we co-initiated the construction of 10,000 charging stations for electric transport in the Netherlands, the first of which have already been completed. Among others, Alliander also works together with the municipality of Amsterdam on the project Amsterdam Smart City. We are collaborating on this initiative in order to reduce CO2 and achieve energy saving goals on a European, national and city-level (Amsterdam). For more examples please refer to our website.
